# Lua

# This section allows the user to grant the Execute permission to "lua" *once* and only *once*
# * The "lua" binary requires Execute permission
# * However, XOWA bundles all binaries in every xowa_app.zip file, including the "lua" binary
# * The problem arises if "xowa_app.zip" file were to include "lua" in /xowa/bin/<OS>/lua/lua
# * When extracting the zip archive, the embedded binary would overwrite the existing one and the Execute permission would be lost
# * Hence, every upgrade would force the user to re-grant the Execute permission to "lua"
#
# To avoid the perpetual re-grant, the following is done:
# * The xowa_app.zip file deploys a binary called "lua_install"
# * The script renames "lua_install" to "lua" and grants Execute to "lua"
# * Subsequent xowa upgrades will then copy down a redundant "lua_install". The existing "lua" is unaffected
#
# This is not an elegant solution, but the only expense is the following:
# * an extra 500 KB file which the user can always delete
# * this script and the accompanying documentation

# Declare variables
