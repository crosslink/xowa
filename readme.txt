  * The xowa_upgrade_*** files are for upgrade users. They will have the xowa jar and any other files specific to the release.
    Note that upgrade users can also download the xowa_app_*** files and unzip it over their current version. The xowa_upgrade_*** files are provided as a convenience.
* The paths below are recommendations. Please feel free to choose any other.

REQUIREMENTS
============
* Java 1.7+
  If you do not have Java 1.7 installed, then please install 1.7 from http://www.java.com/en/download/manual.jsp
  On Ubuntu Linux, you can use OpenJDK by running 'sudo apt-get install openjdk-7-jre'.
* Compression/Decompression program ("unzip")
  The XOWA files will be compressed. If your Operating System does not natively support decompressing, please install 7-Zip from http://7-zip.org.
* 512 MB RAM
  XOWA can run on lower memory machines, but 256 MB is needed for importing the larger wikis (EX: en.wikipedia.org; commons.wikimedia.org)

Linux
-----
* Download 'xowa_app_linux_v*.*.*.*.zip'
* Unzip to '/home/your_user_name/xowa/'. When you are done you should have a file called '/home/your_user_name/xowa/xowa_linux.jar' as well as many others
* Open a terminal and run "sh /home/your_user_name/xowa/xowa_linux.sh"
* If "xowa_linux.sh" doesn't work, run "java -Xmx256m -jar /home/your_user_name/xowa/xowa_linux.jar"

Mac OS X 64-bit
---------------
* Download 'xowa_app_macosx_64_v*.*.*.*.zip'
* Unzip to '/Users/your_user_name/xowa/'. When you are done you should have a file called '/Users/your_user_name/xowa/xowa_macosx_64.jar' as well as many others
* Open a terminal by doing Finder -> Applications -> Utilities -> Terminal
* Run "sh /Users/your_user_name/xowa/xowa_macosx_64.sh"
  If you get a "No Java runtime present" you will need to set up Java on your machine. There are two options:
  * Update to the latest Java 6 by going to http://support.apple.com/kb/DL1572?viewlocale=en_US
    This will be simpler. However, note that Java 6 is an older obsolete version.
  * Download Java 7 by going to java.com
    This will be the most up-to-date Java version. However it requires additional steps.
    * Find your java runtime: Run "/Library/Internet\ Plug-Ins/JavaAppletPlugin.plugin/Contents/Home/bin/java -version" in the terminal to verify the path
    * Assuming your java is at the above location, run XOWA by doing either of the following
      (1) Run the following from the terminal:
          /Library/Internet\ Plug-Ins/JavaAppletPlugin.plugin/Contents/Home/bin/java -Xmx256m -XstartOnFirstThread -Xdock:name=XOWA /Users/your_user_name/xowa/xowa_macosx_64.jar
      (2) Change your official java to the plugin version and then run xowa_macosx_64.sh
          sudo ln -fs /Library/Internet\ Plug-Ins/JavaAppletPlugin.plugin/Contents/Home/bin/java /usr/bin/java          
NOTE: if the XOWA menu bar is not clickable, alt-tab to the terminal and back to XOWA. The menu bar will then be usable

Mac OS X 32-bit
---------------
* Download 'xowa_app_macosx_v*.*.*.*.zip'
* Unzip to '/Users/your_user_name/xowa/'. When you are done you should have a file called '/Users/your_user_name/xowa/xowa_macosx.jar' as well as many others
